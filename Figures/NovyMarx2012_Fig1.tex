  Description from original paper:
  \begin{quote}
  \textit{Fig. 1. Marginal strategy performance. This figures shows the average monthly returns (Panel A), monthly standard deviations (Panel B) and annual Sharpe ratio (Panel C) to winners-minus-losers strategies. Winners and losers are defined as the top and bottom deciles of performance in a single month, respectively, starting lag months prior to portfolio formation. Dark bars show value-weighted results and light bars show equal-weighted results. Average monthly returns for the one month reversals are $-1.04$\% (value-weighted) and $-2.82$\% (equal-weighted). The sample covers April 1927 to December 2010.}
