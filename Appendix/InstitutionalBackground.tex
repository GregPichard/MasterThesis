\section{Institutional background}
\label{app:sec:InstitutionalBackground}
As a matter of conciseness, the description of the legal framework in which ETFs operate and the institutional design (market participants) in \autoref{sec:ETFCharacteristics} (p.\pageref{sec:ETFCharacteristics}) has been kept at its shortest in the main body of this paper. This appendix aims at providing a more exhaustive overview of these topics.
