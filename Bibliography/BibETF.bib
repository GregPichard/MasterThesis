Analyses using either aggregate ETF ownership at the stock level or common ETF ownership at the stock pair level indicate that ETF ownership significantly increases commonality. We show that greater arbitrage opportunities and activity are associated with a larger effect of ETF ownership on commonality. We use two quasi natural experiments that exploit ETF trading halts and the reconstitution of Russell indexes, to establish causality. Our results suggest that ETFs reduce investors' ability to diversify liquidity shocks.},

Over time, expected market illiquidity positively affects ex ante stock excess return (usually called " risk premium "). This complements the positive cross-sectional return-illiquidity relationship. The illiquidity measure here is the average daily ratio of absolute stock return to dollar volume, which is easily obtained from daily stock data for long time series in most stock markets. Illiquidity affects more strongly small firms stocks, suggesting an explanation for the changes " small firm effect " over time. The impact of market illiquidity on stock excess return suggests the existence of illiquidity premium and helps explain the equity premium puzzle.},

ETFs revolutionized the asset management industry by taking market share from traditional investment vehicles such as mutual funds and index futures. Because ETFs rely on arbitrage activity to synchronize their prices with the prices of the underlying portfolio, trading activity at the ETF level translates to trading of the underlying securities. Researchers have found that although ETFs enhance price discovery, they also inject nonfundamental volatility into market prices and affect the correlation structure of returns. Furthermore, ETFs impact the liquidity of the underlying portfolios, especially during events of market stress.},

abstract = {This paper proposes that long rebalancing cascades (stock A's price jumps, which causes a fund to buy stock A and sell stock B, which causes a second fund to sell stock B and buy stock C, which causes...) generate noise in financial markets. First, we use a random-networks model to show that, when funds follow many different threshold-based trading strategies, a change in stock A's fundamentals can trigger a long rebalancing cascade that eventually affects the demand for unrelated stocks, like stock Z. Then, we prove that in a large market it's computationally infeasible to predict whether a long rebalancing cascade will result in buy or sell orders for stock Z. The best you can do is compute stock Z's susceptibility to these erratic non-fundamental demand shocks. By analogy, although the population of France is not a random number, whether this number is even or odd may as well be (Keynes, 1921). Finally, we use data on exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to give empirical evidence for our noise-generating mechanism. We find that, in the days immediately after a stock is announced as an M{\&}A target, unrelated stocks on the other side of the market realize larger increases in trading volume when they are more susceptible to long rebalancing cascades. And, this additional trading volume is associated with higher levels of liquidity and more informed trading, suggesting that market participants view these long rebalancing cascades as noise.},

The deviations are larger in funds holding international or illiquid securities where net asset values are most difficult to determine in real time. To control for stale pricing of the underlying assets, I introduce a novel approach using the cross-section of prices on a group of similar ETFs. Nevertheless, the average pricing band remains economically significant at about 100 basis points, with even larger mispricings in some asset classes. Active trading strategies exploiting such inefficiencies produce substantial abnormal returns before transaction costs, providing further proof of short-term mean-reversion in ETF prices. },

But a wider-angle lens exposes an imposing image of commonality. Quoted spreads, quoted depth, and effective spreads co-move with market- and industry-wide liquidity. After controlling for well-known individual liquidity determinants, such as volatility, volume, and price, common influences remain significant and material. Recognizing the existence of commonality is a key to uncovering some suggestive evidence that inventory risks and asymmetric information both affect intertemporal changes in liquidity.},
