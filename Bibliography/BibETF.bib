abstract = {This paper solves explicitly a simple equilibrium model with liquidity risk. In our liquidity-adjusted capital asset pricing model, a security's required return depends on its expected liquidity as well as on the covariances of its own return and liquidity with the market return and liquidity. In addition, a persistent negative shock to a security's liquidity results in low contemporaneous returns and high predicted future returns. The model provides a unified framework for understanding the various channels through which liquidity risk may affect asset prices. Our empirical results shed light on the total and relative economic significance of these channels and provide evidence of flight to liquidity. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We find, however, that these challenges disappear when controlling for the quality, or its inverse, junk, of a firm. A significant size premium emerges, which is stable through time, robust to specification, not concentrated in microcaps, more consistent across seasons, and evident for non-price-based measures of size, and these results hold in 30 different industries and 24 international equity markets. The resurrected size effect is on par with anomalies such as value and momentum in terms of economic significance and gives rise to new tests of, and challenges for, existing asset pricing theories.},

By the end of 2016, the market share of ETFs exceeded 10{\%} of the total market capitalization traded on US exchanges, representing more than 30{\%} of overall trading volume. ETFs revolutionized the asset management industry by taking market share from traditional investment vehicles such as mutual funds and index futures. Because ETFs rely on arbitrage activity to synchronize their prices with the prices of the underlying portfolio, trading activity at the ETF level translates to trading of the underlying securities. Researchers have found that although ETFs enhance price discovery, they also inject nonfundamental volatility into market prices and affect the correlation structure of returns. Furthermore, ETFs impact the liquidity of the underlying portfolios, especially during events of market stress.},

abstract = {This paper proposes that long rebalancing cascades (stock A's price jumps, which causes a fund to buy stock A and sell stock B, which causes a second fund to sell stock B and buy stock C, which causes...) generate noise in financial markets. First, we use a random-networks model to show that, when funds follow many different threshold-based trading strategies, a change in stock A's fundamentals can trigger a long rebalancing cascade that eventually affects the demand for unrelated stocks, like stock Z. Then, we prove that in a large market it's computationally infeasible to predict whether a long rebalancing cascade will result in buy or sell orders for stock Z. The best you can do is compute stock Z's susceptibility to these erratic non-fundamental demand shocks. By analogy, although the population of France is not a random number, whether this number is even or odd may as well be (Keynes, 1921). Finally, we use data on exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to give empirical evidence for our noise-generating mechanism. We find that, in the days immediately after a stock is announced as an M{\&}A target, unrelated stocks on the other side of the market realize larger increases in trading volume when they are more susceptible to long rebalancing cascades. And, this additional trading volume is associated with higher levels of liquidity and more informed trading, suggesting that market participants view these long rebalancing cascades as noise.},

abstract = {Many panel data sets encountered in macroeconomics, international economics, regional science, and finance are characterized by cross-sectional or "spatial" dependence. Standard techniques that fail to account for this dependence will result in inconsistently estimated standard errors. In this paper we present conditions under which a simple extension of common nonparametric covariance matrix estimation techniques yields standard error estimates that are robust to very general forms of spatial and temporal dependence as the time dimension becomes large. We illustrate the relevance of this approach using Monte Carlo simulations and a number of empirical examples.},

While this disproportionate share of short activity has raised concerns about excessive shorting/naked short-selling of ETFs, we identify an alternative source of ETF shorting related to creation/redemption activities. This source, “operational shorting”, is associated with improved liquidity, but it is also associated with increased systemic risk. In exploring possible mechanisms for this risk relationship, we document a commonality in operational shorting across ETFs that share the same authorized participant and the financial leverage of the authorized participant appears to amplify this commonality.},

There are three stock-market factors: an overall market factor and factors related to firm size and book-to-market equity. There are two bond-market factors, related to maturity and default risks. Stock returns have shared variation due to the stock-market factors, and they are linked to bond returns through shared variation in the bond-market factors. Except for low-grade corporates, the bond-market factors capture the common variation in bond returns. Most important, the five factors seem to explain average returns on stocks and bonds. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {Berkshire Hathaway has realized a Sharpe ratio of 0.76 [19{\%}/24.9{\%}], higher than any other stock or mutual fund with a history of more than 30 years(market has a Sharpe of 0.39 [6.1{\%}/15.8{\%}]), and Berkshire has a significant alpha to traditional risk factors. However, we find that the alpha becomes insignificant when controlling for exposures to Betting-Against-Beta (tendency to buy safe/low-beta stocks while shying away from risky/high-beta stocks) and Quality-Minus-Junk factors (a tendency to buy high quality companies, that is, companies that are profitable, growing, safe, and have high payouts). Further, we estimate that Buffett's leverage is about 1.6-to-1 on average. Buffett's returns appear to be neither luck nor magic, but, rather, reward for the use of leverage combined with a focus on cheap, safe, quality stocks. Decomposing Berkshires' portfolio into ownership in publicly traded stocks versus wholly-owned private companies, we find that the former performs the best, suggesting that Buffett's returns are more due to stock selection than to his effect on management. These results have broad implications for market efficiency and the implementability of academic factors. ------------------------------------- 1. his focus on safe quality stocks may in fact be at least as important to his performance. "I could give you other personal examples of "bargain-purchase" folly but I am sure you get the picture: it's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price. 2. Diminishing return on BRK for 1) as it grew, so did transaction costs and this could potentially account for some; 2). initially focused on small firms and only became biased towards large stocks in the later time period. possibly related to capacity constraints. 3). tax advantage is a wash. multiational company is a associated with tax advantages, but for public stocks BRK faces double corporate taxes. 3. The efficient market counter argument is that Buffet may just have been lucky. Our findings suggest that Buffett's success is not luck or chance, but reward for a successful implementation of exposure to factors that have historically produced high returns. 4. Anomalous cost of leverage: debt -- AAA rating from 1989 to 2009. Insurance float is only 2.2{\%}, more than 3{\%} points below the average T-bill rate. Low cost insurance and reinsurance business have given him a significant advantage in terms of unique access to cheap leverage. {\~{}}36{\%} of BRK's liabilities consist of insurance float on average.},

abstract = {In this paper we study the implications of general-purpose technological growth for asset prices. The model features two types of shocks: "small", frequent, and disembodied shocks to productivity and "large" technological innovations, which are embodied into new vintages of the capital stock. While the former affect the economy on impact, the latter affect the economy with lags, since firms need to first adopt the new technologies through investment. The process of adoption leads to cycles in asset valuations and risk premia as firms convert the growth options associated with the new technologies into assets in place. This process can help provide a unified, investment-based view of some well documented phenomena such as the asset-valuation patterns around major technological innovations, the countercyclical behavior of returns, the lead-lag relationship between the stock market and output, and the increasing patterns of consumption-return correlations over longer horizons.},

Further analysis shows that the channels for these comovements derive from both common ownership across funds and funds' correlated liquidity shocks.

@article{Krause2014,
abstract = {Given the exponential growth in exchange-traded fund (ETF) trading, ETFs have become a significant factor in the volatility generating process of their largest component stocks. A simple model of trading is developed for securities that are included in ETFs, and empirical support is provided for the model hypotheses. Volatility spillovers from ETFs to their largest component stocks are economically significant. These spillovers are increasing in liquidity, the proportion of each stock held by the fund, deviations from net asset value, ETF flow of funds and ETF market capitalization. The results are consistent with a positive volume–volatility relation and trading-based explanations of volatility, and are generally stronger for smaller stocks.},

abstract = {We examine both theoretically and empirically whether increased trading activity in index futures and exchange traded funds (ETFs) is associated with higher equity return correlations. Our model predicts that demand shocks to ETFs and futures lead to stronger price comovement for index stocks and non-index stocks. Moreover, demand shocks to ETFs have a higher impact on stock return correlations than shocks to futures. We confirm the model predictions by studying the correlation of U.S. stocks after the inception of S{\&}P 500 futures and ETFs. Furthermore, our empirical results suggest that the return comovement induced by index trading is excessive.},

@article{Novy-Marx2013,
abstract = {Profitability, measured by gross profits-to-assets, has roughly the same power as book-to-market predicting the cross section of average returns. Profitable firms generate significantly higher returns than unprofitable firms, despite having significantly higher valuation ratios. Controlling for profitability also dramatically increases the performance of value strategies, especially among the largest, most liquid stocks. These results are difficult to reconcile with popular explanations of the value premium, as profitable firms are less prone to distress, have longer cash flow durations, and have lower levels of operating leverage. Controlling for gross profitability explains most earnings related anomalies and a wide range of seemingly unrelated profitable trading strategies.},

@article{Petajisto2017,
abstract = {The prices of exchange-traded funds can deviate significantly from their net asset values, on average fluctuating within a band of about 200 basis points, in spite of the arbitrage mechanism that allows authorized participants to create and redeem shares for the underlying portfolios. The deviations are larger in funds holding international or illiquid securities where net asset values are most difficult to determine in real time. To control for stale pricing of the underlying assets, I introduce a novel approach using the cross-section of prices on a group of similar ETFs. Nevertheless, the average pricing band remains economically significant at about 100 basis points, with even larger mispricings in some asset classes. Active trading strategies exploiting such inefficiencies produce substantial abnormal returns before transaction costs, providing further proof of short-term mean-reversion in ETF prices. },

We find that a firm's revenues, costs, and growth options combine to determine the dynamics of its return autocorrelation. We use these insights to implement momentum strategies (buying winners and selling losers) with both numerically simulated returns and CRSP/Compustat data. In both sets of data, momentum strategies that use firms with high revenue growth volatility, low costs, or valuable growth options outperform traditional momentum strategies by approximately 5{\%} per year. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Traditionally and understandably, the microscope of market microstructure has focused on attributes of single assets. Little theoretical attention and virtually no empirical work has been devoted to common determinants of liquidity nor to their empirical manifestation, correlated movements in liquidity. But a wider-angle lens exposes an imposing image of commonality. Quoted spreads, quoted depth, and effective spreads co-move with market- and industry-wide liquidity. After controlling for well-known individual liquidity determinants, such as volatility, volume, and price, common influences remain significant and material. Recognizing the existence of commonality is a key to uncovering some suggestive evidence that inventory risks and asymmetric information both affect intertemporal changes in liquidity.},

These heuristics are highly economical and usually effective, but they lead to systematic and predictable errors. A better understanding of these heuristics and of the biases to which they lead could improve judgements and decisions in situations of uncertainty.},
