\section{Panel regression results and discussion}
\label{sec:Results}
In this whole section, descriptive statistics and results will always be given in the same order : first the U.S. stocks' sample, which is a tentative replication of \textcite{Ben-David2018} and then the international stocks' sample, which is the newer contribution of this paper. The models tested are the same across both samples.
\subsection{Summary statistics}
\input{SummaryStats/SummaryStats.tex}
\subsection{ETF ownership and underlying stocks' volatility}
\label{sec:Results:sub:Volatility}

For the sake of completeness, more detail is reported in the appendix, \autoref{app:sec:DetailedResults:Volatility}, p.\pageref{app:sec:DetailedResults:Volatility},  about the panel estimation results testing the relationship between the share of ETF ownership in securities and the held securities' daily returns volatility. 

\subsection{ETF ownership and underlying stocks' liquidity}
\label{sec:Results:sub:Liquidity}

Even though no significant effect has been found so far in this subsection, more detail is reported in the appendix, \autoref{app:sec:DetailedResults:Liquidity}, p.\pageref{app:sec:DetailedResults:Liquidity},  about the panel estimation results testing the relationship between the share of ETF ownership in securities and the statistics linked with stock-level liquidity (bid-ask spread, \textcite{Amihud2002} ratio decomposition).
\subsection{ETF ownership and concerns about pricing efficiency}
\label{sec:Results:sub:Efficiency}

Despite the, at best fragile, evidence exhibited in this subsection, more detail is reported in the appendix, \autoref{app:sec:DetailedResults:Efficiency}, p.\pageref{app:sec:DetailedResults:Efficiency}, about the panel estimation results testing the relationship between the share of ETF ownership in securities and the statistics of mean reversion.
