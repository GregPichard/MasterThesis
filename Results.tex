\section{Panel regression results and discussion}
\label{sec:Results}
In this whole section, descriptive statistics and results will always be given in the same order : first the U.S. stocks' sample, which is a tentative replication of \textcite{Ben-David2018} and then the international stocks' sample, which is the newer contribution of this paper. The models tested are the same across both samples.
