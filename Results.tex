\section{Panel regression results and discussion}
\label{sec:Results}
In this whole section, descriptive statistics and results will always be given in the same order : first the U.S. stocks' sample, which is a tentative replication of \textcite{Ben-David2018} and then the international (non-U.S.) stocks' sample, which is one of the newer contribution of this paper. The model specifications tested are the same across both samples, which makes qualitative comparisons between both distinct populations more intuitive. All regressions are performed using a heteroskedasticity and auto-correlation robust covariance estimator following the methodology introduced in \textcite{Driscoll1998} for panel and spatial regressions based on the widely-used HAC estimator from \textcite{Newey1987}. Through comparisons that are not displayed here, it has been steadily noticed that the \textcite{Newey1987} tends to yield more conservative estimates (thus lower t-stats in absolute value) than the heteroskedasticity-robust estimator with clustering both on entities (stocks) and time. Nevertheless, and that is why such comparisons are not disclosed, the degree of significance of coefficient estimates does not change the conclusions drawn from the three models tested.  The estimation methodology, whose implementation is automated through a statistical package, is explained in \autoref{app:sec:EconometricDefinitions} as well as several statistics displayed in the exhibits.

For the sake of completeness, more detail is reported in the appendix, \autoref{app:sec:DetailedResults:Volatility}, p.\pageref{app:sec:DetailedResults:Volatility},  about the panel estimation results testing the relationship between the share of ETF ownership in securities and the held securities' daily returns volatility.

Even though no significant effect has been found so far in this subsection, more detail is reported in the appendix, \autoref{app:sec:DetailedResults:Liquidity}, p.\pageref{app:sec:DetailedResults:Liquidity},  about the panel estimation results testing the relationship between the share of ETF ownership in securities and the statistics linked with stock-level liquidity (bid-ask spread, \textcite{Amihud2002} ratio decomposition).

Despite the, at best fragile, evidence exhibited in this subsection, more detail is reported in the appendix, \autoref{app:sec:DetailedResults:Efficiency}, p.\pageref{app:sec:DetailedResults:Efficiency}, about the panel estimation results testing the relationship between the share of ETF ownership in securities and the statistics of mean reversion.
